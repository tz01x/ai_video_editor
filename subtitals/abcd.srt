Welcome to today's video.

1
0:00:01.440 --> 0:00:05.360
Merry Christmas if you celebrated Happy Holidays, if you celebrate something else.

2
0:00:05.680 --> 0:00:10.380
Today we are going to talk about four ways that you can make small talk with anyone and

3
0:00:10.380 --> 0:00:13.780
make it effortless and fun so the person almost instantly likes you.

4
0:00:14.060 --> 0:00:15.940
Before we jump in there's two quick things.

5
0:00:15.940 --> 0:00:21.190
One, we are doing a kind of online raffle with never done this before to give a free hour

6
0:00:21.190 --> 0:00:24.620
of coaching that's normally worth $500 to three people.

7
0:00:24.920 --> 0:00:27.520
So there's more details about that at the end of the video.

8
0:00:27.960 --> 0:00:31.740
It's going to run for the next three weeks so you don't have to rush there now but at the end

9
0:00:31.740 --> 0:00:33.680
of the video there's more details on that.

10
0:00:33.980 --> 0:00:38.000
And second, this video assumes you are already in conversation.

11
0:00:38.080 --> 0:00:43.560
So if you want to know how to get into conversation I will put a video in one of these corners

12
0:00:43.940 --> 0:00:48.670
that Charlie made about three easy ways to start a conversation with anyone and I will also

13
0:00:48.670 --> 0:00:52.560
link to that at the end of this video so you can watch that if that is something that

14
0:00:52.560 --> 0:00:53.260
interests you.

15
0:00:53.640 --> 0:00:55.140
So small talk.

16
0:00:55.820 --> 0:00:56.900
What is the point of small talk?

17
0:00:56.960 --> 0:00:57.660
Why do we do it?

18
0:00:57.800 --> 0:01:01.550
I think that's the first important thing to cover before we talk about how to do it.

19
0:01:01.550 --> 0:01:06.610
And the answer is complicated but in my opinion it kind of blows down the three things which

20
0:01:06.610 --> 0:01:11.280
is you want to learn about someone new or learn something new about someone that you know.

21
0:01:11.580 --> 0:01:12.580
You want to see if you connect.

22
0:01:12.580 --> 0:01:16.150
You want to see if there's a relationship worth pursuing there if you guys get along and

23
0:01:16.150 --> 0:01:19.480
you want a friendship or to be dating or a mentorship whatever it might be.

24
0:01:19.720 --> 0:01:23.620
And three, you want to have fun and you want it to be fun for them.

25
0:01:23.820 --> 0:01:25.220
You want it to be an enjoyable experience.

26
0:01:25.400 --> 0:01:30.660
So with that said here are four ways that you can make small talk so that it's not

27
0:01:30.760 --> 0:01:35.540
a boring interview, ask, vibe or a bunch of awkward silences and forced conversation.

28
0:01:36.000 --> 0:01:41.200
The first thing is a compliment plus cold read and I actually didn't invent this.

29
0:01:41.260 --> 0:01:46.100
Someone I think a natural just did this to me when I was at an event one time and it

30
0:01:46.100 --> 0:01:47.640
really made an impression on me.

31
0:01:47.640 --> 0:01:51.240
So I was in a group of maybe four or five people where we're all getting know each other

32
0:01:51.240 --> 0:01:55.200
for the first time and I made a couple jokes and I had people laughing and this woman

33
0:01:55.240 --> 0:01:56.460
asked me if I was a comedian.

34
0:01:56.580 --> 0:01:58.240
She said, oh my god, you're so funny.

35
0:01:58.480 --> 0:01:59.170
Are you a comedian?

36
0:01:59.170 --> 0:02:03.350
That's a compliment and then a cold read which is just a guess at something about them

37
0:02:03.350 --> 0:02:06.520
where they're from, what they do, a hobby, whatever it was.

38
0:02:07.460 --> 0:02:10.250
But I will tell you, I instantly really liked that woman.

39
0:02:10.250 --> 0:02:14.560
She made me feel so good about myself and I did start talking about what I actually do.

40
0:02:14.860 --> 0:02:19.080
But the impact it had on me versus if she had just said, oh by the way, what's your job

41
0:02:19.320 --> 0:02:21.020
was so much stronger.

42
0:02:21.700 --> 0:02:24.470
So this can be anything from, wow, you're really extroverted.

43
0:02:24.470 --> 0:02:27.440
I bet you're great at sales or wow, you have incredible fashion.

44
0:02:27.440 --> 0:02:32.250
I bet you're a stylist and if you're right, great bonus points, the laugh and wonder how

45
0:02:32.250 --> 0:02:32.740
you knew it.

46
0:02:32.740 --> 0:02:35.400
But if you're wrong, there's no knock.

47
0:02:35.480 --> 0:02:36.580
There's no talent involved.

48
0:02:36.580 --> 0:02:37.730
You don't have to get this right.

49
0:02:37.730 --> 0:02:41.640
You're just giving the compliment, giving a guess and then they will tell you whatever

50
0:02:41.640 --> 0:02:43.500
it is what they do or where they're from.

51
0:02:43.640 --> 0:02:47.800
It sets a fun vibe, it gets sort of that interview vibe and they will really appreciate

52
0:02:47.800 --> 0:02:52.020
the compliment which will make them much more likely to engage in the conversation fully.

53
0:02:52.560 --> 0:02:57.070
The second thing, sticking with the cold theme is something I consider creating an

54
0:02:57.070 --> 0:03:01.480
avalanche of words and specifically creating an avalanche of words with a good question.

55
0:03:01.900 --> 0:03:05.930
So the goal here is instead of getting those one word answers where someone really doesn't

56
0:03:05.930 --> 0:03:10.780
engage you in conversation, the goal is to ask them something that gets them talking and

57
0:03:10.780 --> 0:03:14.730
talking and talking almost word vomiting because they're so excited about what you

58
0:03:14.730 --> 0:03:15.380
ask them.

59
0:03:15.720 --> 0:03:19.140
There's two ways you can do this and if you combine them, it's even more powerful.

60
0:03:19.840 --> 0:03:23.160
First is try to avoid questions that have one word answers.

61
0:03:24.180 --> 0:03:25.510
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?

62
0:03:25.510 --> 0:03:30.680
It's a pretty boring small talk question that I get asked a lot because I live here now.

63
0:03:30.800 --> 0:03:35.540
And yes, there's a charismatic way to answer it with your whole backstory but most people

64
0:03:35.600 --> 0:03:40.210
if they're not great conversationalists are just going to say, oh six months, five years,

65
0:03:40.210 --> 0:03:41.420
whatever the answer is.

66
0:03:41.920 --> 0:03:46.850
Instead, if you ask them a question that gets them talking more like, why did you move

67
0:03:46.850 --> 0:03:49.120
to LA or what do you do for fun?

68
0:03:49.280 --> 0:03:53.560
You will get them to engage in a longer answer, get them talking, they'll give you more

69
0:03:53.560 --> 0:03:57.660
to respond to, you'll have a much more natural conversation full of different threads

70
0:03:57.660 --> 0:03:58.360
you can take.

71
0:03:58.840 --> 0:04:02.670
The second thing is ask them something that they're going to want to answer because

72
0:04:02.670 --> 0:04:05.080
they like talking about what you've asked.

73
0:04:05.380 --> 0:04:08.040
So a lot of people ask about work, they'll say, hey, how's work going?

74
0:04:08.160 --> 0:04:11.800
It's a terrible question in my opinion because one, you can say good, bad, whatever.

75
0:04:12.420 --> 0:04:14.400
Two, they might not like their job.

76
0:04:14.800 --> 0:04:18.400
But instead, if you can ask what's exciting at work these days, or even better what's exciting

77
0:04:18.400 --> 0:04:20.480
in life these days, or what do you do for fun?

78
0:04:20.860 --> 0:04:25.240
Now the person is more likely to engage and talk because they like talking about what they

79
0:04:25.240 --> 0:04:29.400
like, they're thinking about what they like, associating it with you, creating that positive

80
0:04:29.400 --> 0:04:33.090
vibe between you guys, and now you have an opportunity to connect on something they care

81
0:04:33.090 --> 0:04:33.580
about.

82
0:04:34.260 --> 0:04:37.340
The third thing you can do is make a guessing game of it.

83
0:04:37.360 --> 0:04:38.630
I really like to do this.

84
0:04:38.630 --> 0:04:40.660
Don't do this all the time for every question.

85
0:04:41.240 --> 0:04:44.930
But if you find yourself asking a question that seems kind of boring and you catch it,

86
0:04:44.930 --> 0:04:46.860
who say, where are you from?

87
0:04:47.160 --> 0:04:49.430
Then immediately turn it into a guessing game, go where are you from?

88
0:04:49.430 --> 0:04:50.970
Wait, give me two hints.

89
0:04:50.970 --> 0:04:52.260
Let me see if I can guess.

90
0:04:52.620 --> 0:04:56.400
And the person will probably appreciate that you're making this conversation more fun, though.

91
0:04:56.400 --> 0:04:58.520
Give you hints, they'll have to think about what to say.

92
0:04:58.680 --> 0:04:59.330
You'll try to guess.

93
0:04:59.330 --> 0:05:03.040
You'll be laughing and smiling when you eventually do find out where they're from.

94
0:05:03.040 --> 0:05:05.320
It's a much more fun process to get there.

95
0:05:05.520 --> 0:05:07.340
Now you wouldn't want to do this in any situation.

96
0:05:07.420 --> 0:05:10.320
You wouldn't want to do this if you're small talking, your boss, let's say.

97
0:05:10.700 --> 0:05:14.160
It's really useful in social situations, bars, things like that.

98
0:05:14.560 --> 0:05:17.290
And honestly, anytime it feels appropriate, it is fun.

99
0:05:17.290 --> 0:05:21.570
It is much more fun than just asking a series of where you're from, what do you do, how

100
0:05:21.570 --> 0:05:21.880
will they?

101
0:05:22.040 --> 0:05:26.820
That most small talk evolves into until you're talking about traffic or the weather, because

102
0:05:26.980 --> 0:05:28.460
you just don't know what else to say.

103
0:05:29.200 --> 0:05:34.060
So I like to mix and match with those three things a lot with the guessing game and questions

104
0:05:34.060 --> 0:05:36.820
that get them talking and the compliments and the cold reads.

105
0:05:37.300 --> 0:05:42.350
The fourth thing I like, because you're not going to talk about them necessarily, but

106
0:05:42.350 --> 0:05:46.920
you're going to, you list it their advice or their opinion and show that you value what

107
0:05:46.920 --> 0:05:47.520
they think.

108
0:05:47.920 --> 0:05:49.280
And it's a very simple question.

109
0:05:49.280 --> 0:05:51.780
It's just, hey, I have a quick question for you.

110
0:05:51.920 --> 0:05:54.270
And then anything that you genuinely think is interesting.

111
0:05:54.270 --> 0:05:59.320
Now, unlike the avalanche, which is about what they think is interesting, this is really,

112
0:05:59.460 --> 0:06:01.900
what do you like, what do you think is interesting to talk about?

113
0:06:02.120 --> 0:06:06.560
And you're trying to engage with them on this instead of just the regular list of topics

114
0:06:06.580 --> 0:06:09.080
that everybody asks about when they're making small talks.

115
0:06:09.160 --> 0:06:14.310
So this can be anything from super light to kind of deep when Charlie and his brother, Henry

116
0:06:14.310 --> 0:06:17.250
and I went out to a restaurant the other day, they were wearing ugly Christmas sweaters.

117
0:06:17.250 --> 0:06:21.100
And so we just started asking the people sitting around us and the waitresses and the

118
0:06:21.100 --> 0:06:23.320
hostesses, which sweater they liked more.

119
0:06:23.580 --> 0:06:26.890
And then they could guess and then we could tease or they could pretend, oh, it's just

120
0:06:26.890 --> 0:06:28.850
because you like Charlie more than Henry, it's not the sweater.

121
0:06:28.850 --> 0:06:34.510
It made a fun vibe for everyone around us much more so than if we just said, hi, what's

122
0:06:34.510 --> 0:06:34.920
your name?

123
0:06:34.960 --> 0:06:35.560
Here's my order.

124
0:06:35.960 --> 0:06:37.720
I want this sandwich, whatever it might be.

125
0:06:38.000 --> 0:06:41.490
The other thing you can do is go a lot deeper and especially with people that you know

126
0:06:41.490 --> 0:06:45.750
a little bit or you've met before, this is a really easy way to create a more interesting

127
0:06:45.750 --> 0:06:47.780
conversation than just how things been going.

128
0:06:47.780 --> 0:06:52.500
So anytime I am with extended family and I'm with somebody who was married for a long

129
0:06:52.500 --> 0:06:56.780
time or had a marriage that didn't work, I like to just ask them, hey, I've never been married,

130
0:06:56.780 --> 0:06:57.720
I'm in a relationship.

131
0:06:58.340 --> 0:07:02.010
I would love to know your thoughts on what makes a long-term relationship work or what

132
0:07:02.010 --> 0:07:02.600
doesn't.

133
0:07:03.300 --> 0:07:07.060
And what's nice about this question is if they're happily married, they're going to

134
0:07:07.060 --> 0:07:09.720
be happy to tell you what has worked for them.

135
0:07:10.000 --> 0:07:13.450
Interestingly enough, if they aren't happily married or they're struggling or they're

136
0:07:13.450 --> 0:07:17.910
divorced, they're still really actually pretty excited to talk to you because I've seen

137
0:07:17.910 --> 0:07:22.680
an instinct where people want to help you to avoid the mistakes that they've made or the

138
0:07:22.760 --> 0:07:23.610
suffering that they've had.

139
0:07:23.610 --> 0:07:28.380
So a question like that, if you find it interesting like I do because you like relationships

140
0:07:28.420 --> 0:07:33.750
and psychology can start a really interesting conversation much more so than how

141
0:07:33.750 --> 0:07:36.820
the kids, how's the job, the questions that everybody asks.

142
0:07:37.040 --> 0:07:41.880
So those are the four things that can help you to make a small talk conversation interesting

143
0:07:41.880 --> 0:07:44.500
and fun and feel effortless and natural.

144
0:07:44.600 --> 0:07:49.060
And that is a compliment and a cold read, a question that creates an avalanche of words,

145
0:07:49.440 --> 0:07:55.420
having them play a guessing game of any kind or telling them that you want to know their

146
0:07:55.420 --> 0:08:00.600
opinion on a question or something that you find interesting that you want to kind of bring

147
0:08:00.620 --> 0:08:02.620
into the conversation via a question.

148
0:08:02.860 --> 0:08:07.990
Also, if you want that video on how to start conversations that Charlie made, you can click

149
0:08:07.990 --> 0:08:12.590
here and if you want a video Charlie made on how to make an amazing first impression and

150
0:08:12.590 --> 0:08:16.380
specifically the four emotions that guarantee a great first impression, you can click

151
0:08:16.380 --> 0:08:16.740
here.

152
0:08:17.120 --> 0:08:18.520
So thank you so much for watching.

153
0:08:18.660 --> 0:08:21.200
I hope that you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.
